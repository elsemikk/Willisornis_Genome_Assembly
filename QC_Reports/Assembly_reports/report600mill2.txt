ALARMS
- The length-weighted mean molecule length is 25041.42 bases. If this value is <
0, it means that the molecule length estimation failed. This could be because
your input DNA was very short, or because coverage was too low, or some other
reason. Check for other alerts, which may be diagnostic. If the predicted value
is > 0, the molecule length estimation was successful. However, ideally, we
would expect a larger value. Standard methods starting from blood can yield 100
kb or larger DNA, but it can be difficult to obtain long DNA from other sample
types. Short molecules may reduce the scaffold and phase block N50 length, and
could result in misassemblies. We have observed assembly quality to improve with
longer DNA.
