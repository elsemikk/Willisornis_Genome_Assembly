ALARMS
- The length-weighted mean molecule length is 24793.48 bases. The molecule
length estimation was successful, however, ideally we would expect a larger
value. Standard methods starting from blood can yield 100 kb or larger DNA, but
it can be difficult to obtain long DNA from other sample types. Short molecules
may reduce the scaffold and phase block N50 length, and could result in
misassemblies. We have observed assembly quality to improve with longer DNA.
